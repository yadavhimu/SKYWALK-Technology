              Earlier SaaS was the key model that companies adopted, but that is
              no longer the case considering increased costs, limited
              customizations and vague data ownership terms. Moreover, as
              business workflows become more elaborate, custom software that can
              solve business needs without having to work around the limitations
              of off-the-shelf software become necessary.
